## About this project

The goal of this project is to create a simple (yet deadly ðŸ’€) interactive number guessing game that runs in the browser using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Inspired by the thrilling theme of "Squid Game", players need to guess a number between 1 and 20, with only a limited number of chances to get it right. The game features various setups for winning and losing, hint functionality, and responsive design.

## Rules

- The player is asked to guess a number between 1 and 20.
- The player has 10 chances to guess the number correctly.
- Each incorrect guess results in a loss of 1 chance.
- Using a hint will cost 2 additional chances.
- If the player guesses correctly, the game switches to a "winner" setup.
- If the player runs out of chances, the game switches to a "game over" setup.

## Features

- CSS Flexbox is used to arrange HTML elements.
- Different game setups are implemented using CSS classes and JavaScript for winning or losing scenarios.
- Media queries are included for responsive design.
- DOM manipulation with JavaScript adds functionality to buttons and manages game logic.
- A modal window is provided to display hints if the player chooses to use them.
